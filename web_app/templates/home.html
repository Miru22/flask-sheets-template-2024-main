<h1>Simple Justice</h1>

<p class="lead">
  This website purpose is to provide a repository of how judges rule. Let's
  perform a simple thought experiment. If you were to look up a Congressman,
  Senator, or even a city counsilman how the individual voted on issues it would
  not much digging besides a few Google searches to find the information. The
  problem with judges however, is that their decisions impact children and
  families. Getting these decisions wrong has lifelong impacts.
